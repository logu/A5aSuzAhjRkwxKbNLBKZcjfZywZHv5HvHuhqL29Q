# Bonus exercise

INSTRUCTION :

You are expected to build a JavaScript application that lets users write hierarchical lists.
We need to get an MVP out very soon, which will be incrementally augmented under tight
deadlines.
The main goal is that the application be easy to use and intuitive.
The initial shipment should allow writing a list element, indenting or de-indenting it using the
mouse, and to nest other list items below it.
Ultimately, the application should
- be able to export its content in the OPML format (http://dev.opml.org/)
- allow collaborative edition
- be entirely useable with the keyboard
- support Markdown (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for formatting
- handle master-lists (lists of links to lists)
And do much more; the product owner is bustling with ideas.
